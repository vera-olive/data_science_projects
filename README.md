# World Development Indicators exploration with SQL

## Hello! 
This repo contains a data analysis project in the form of Jupyter notebooks. This is done for self learning purposes.

In this project, I use SQL to explore indicators in the World Development Indicators (WDI). The WDI is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.
